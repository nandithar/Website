								<p>Hi! My name is Nanditha and I am a student at the University of Washington double majoring in Economics and Political Science and minoring in Entrepreneurship. I believe that this gives me a unique perspective as I love learning and applying qualitative outlooks that I have learned in Politics with quantitative data and observations I learn in Economics in order to gain more insight. Here are some of <a href="#skills"> the skills I am most proud of</a>.</p>
								<p>In my free time, I love going to the gym, playing sports, painting, and going on adventures with my friends and family. I also love traveling and experiencing new cultures and customs and have been to over 15 different countries with my family. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Skills</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="skills.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p><b>Creativity:</b>  I have always been fascinated with how different individuals think and express themselves and have noticed the practicality of creativity throughout my experiences thus far. Besides being a facet to understand myself in a means that surpasses words, creativity has enabled me to come up with innovative solutions for problems that I have encountered. These issues range from small scale organization in my daily life to solutions for stress in college campuses or cognitive games for disabled children to play. </p>

								<p><b>Adaptability:</b> Growing up, I moved a lot from country to country. I was born in India but moved to France shortly after and then moved to California. Moving around did pose a set of challenges but provided me with a key skill that I am extremely thankful for:adaptability. Being in a country whose language I didn't speak and whose people I did not resemble was hard at first, but allowed me to read situations and understand different perspectives and cultures much more easily. Now, being in new situations excites me. I love being pushed outside my comfort zone and live by the statement "seek discomfort" as that is when you learn most about yourself. </p>

								<p><b>Languages:</b> Moving around also provided me with a way to understand new cultures. Along with this came learning new languages. My mother tongue is Tamil which enables me to understand my roots and relate to my family. I learned English at the same time which allowed me to communicate with a vast group of individuals. Living in Paris, I picked up French fairly quickly. Though it was initially a means to assimilate, I began to fall in love with the language. These languages also add to my unique perspective and allow me to connect with individuals from various backgrounds. Whether it is interacting with a customer on a personal level by speaking French as a Sales Representative at TargetTech or interacting with Tamil co-workers when I worked as a Teacher's Assistant teaching disabled children in India, breaking the barriers of language is extremely important to me.

								<p><b>Other skills:</b> Basic HTML, Social Media Marketing, Logo Design, Proficiency in Microsoft Office (Excel,Word,Powerpoint), Product testing, Strong Written and Verbal Skills, Disabiliy teaching, Public Speaking.

								<h2 class="major">Past Experiences</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="experience.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><b>Petrichor- Rho Innovate, Alpha Kappa Psi</b> Along with a few of my peers in my Business Fraternity, Alpha Kappa Psi, I founded a company to address the overwhelming stress, anxiety, and other mental issues that college students like I faced. I grew up learning about the numerous benefits of aromatherapy but noticed that a lot of my peers were not aware of its benefits. I wanted to bring this knowledge to my peers in the form of fashionable aromatherapy bracelets that combined aesthetics with functionality. My prominent role for the company is primarily in the realm of Finance- I handle all purchases, use pricing strategies to increase profit margins, track all expenses, and use applications such as Excel to make organized budget sheets and financial records. Also, I help with the marketing of the product, as well as the branding and logo design.</p>

								 <p><b>Workato- Product Intern </b> Workato is a Software startup in Silicon Valley and I worked primarily as a Product Intern for the company. My responsibilities included updating the documentation website using basic HTML to further enhance the user interface and accessibility. I was able to use my love for writing and apply it to technical product writing to create a cohesive website for users. I also transferred, synthesized and organized information and used sample codes to aid new users in understanding the possible uses for the product. In addition to this, I was able to help with product testing to help identify the benefits and potential drawbacks of the product and ways to address them. 
							
                                <p><b> MarketSource: TargetTech- Sales Representative </b> I also worked as a Sales Representative at Target Tech and was given the goal of accelerating sales of high-end tech equipment. To do this, my co-workers and I discussed potential sales and marketing strategies and also worked to educate customers about our products and their benefits.

								 <p><b> Spastic Society- Teacher's Assistant</b> I go to India every summer to meet my family and on one of my trips I noticed a school for impoverished families with disabled children. After talking to the teachers there, I became passionate about helping and learning about their methods of teaching. While I was there, I noticed that the school did not have the funds to buy expensive games for the children to play to improve and develop sensory and motor skills. Using what I had at homes such as paint, pictures, popsicle sticks and shoeboxes, I came up with games for the students to play that improved color recognition, numbers, and cognitive abilities.
